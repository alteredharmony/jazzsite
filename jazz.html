      <h1>Nick's Jazz Guitar Emporium</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Hello there internet! I'm Nick. I play guitar. Lately I've been trying to learn jazz guitar. This has been quite a process with lots of struggle. I have spent quite a bit of time researching how to play. While I don't feel that I am in the position to teach jazz guitar I did want to make a place to organize the information I have learned in case someone wants to learn along with me. So here goes!

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            In my understanding of music there are two approaches to learning it. 
            <ol>
                <li>With sheet music</li>
                <li>By ear</li>
            </ol>
            These are not mutually exclusive approaches to learning but how you approach each one will completely change your relationship to music. Historically jazz has been learned by ear. Jazz musicians in the days that jazz formed listened to each other and learned from listening to other jazz musicians. I would argue that in jazz your ear is your main instrument. Getting your ear to connect to your instrument is your primary technique in jazz. Learn jazz language, play jazz language, hear jazz language.
        </p>

        <p>
          All this is not to say that there is no use in learning to read music or learning a jazz song by reading. It is merely to say that hearing jazz in your mind is very important. While learning some jazz language by reading may be helpful, it is <i>also important</i> to listen closely to jazz and be able to pick up the infelctions of it. An analogy would be to learing a language. If you only learned to read a languiage, that would not be sufficient to be able to speak it.
        </p>

        <p>
          With this in mind here are some things to do to learn jazz language.
          <ol>
            <li>Listen to jazz passively</li>
            <li>Listen to jazz actively</li>
            <li>Learn jazz songs</li>
            <li>Learn jazz licks</li>
            <li>Learn jazz solos</li>
            <li>Learn jazz rhythms</li>
            <li>Learn at least some songs, licks and solos by ear</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        Another important skill to have is to be able to play your instrument fluently. When you hear jazz language in your head, you want to be able to easily translate it onto your instruement. Some of the skills to do this will be specific to your instrument and others will apply to many or all instruments.
      </p>

      <p>
        My primary instruement is the guitar, so the following examples are examples of skills to have for the guitar. If you don't play guitar then you could brainstorm or research skills that you must have to play your instrument. If you do play guitar then you may brainstorm or research other skills that you may want to know for your instrument. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a list of techniques that may help in playing guitar. Many of the other skills listed in this page can be used to increase techniques, especially scales, arpeggios, and chord progressions. Those are typically what are practiced to improve these techniques.
